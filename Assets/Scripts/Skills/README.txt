TO DO:
- Skill System Feature

- When selecting unit bring up a UI
- UI has three options:
- attack, skills and wait
- attack is just a regular attack which already exists
- skills will bring up another UI from which that unit can select a skill to use
- skills are in three categories, offense skills, support skills and healing skills
- more ideas of skills for this feature may come down the line
- wait just ends the action of that unit

2 ways:
- sp point starts at x and builds up by y each turn
- sp point bar with set amount (no regeneration)

Ideas:
Knight
Savage Blow - Deal a powerful strike. 
(5 damage, 1 range) (1 sp)

Archer
Deadeye - Snipe a target from a further distance. 
(2 damage, 3 range) (1 sp)

Captain
Charge! - Raise the morale of an ally. 
(+2 atk buff to an ally end of turn?, 2 range) (1 sp)
