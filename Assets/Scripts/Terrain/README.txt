TO DO:
- Terrain Interaction Feature
- Terrain UI

- terrain is treated like a unit except it will have its own UI
- this could be the stats it provides if a unit makes use of it

- terrain interaction is just terrain that can be interacted with
- the whole idea is to give more options to the player
- terrain will also have its own team which will be a neutral team
- the neutral team is so both players can interact with it
- a general approach is to treat it like an enemy so when its hp hits 0 something happens
- this something could dealing damage to units on a specific tile
- or it could be nothing and maybe the interactable terrain serves as a barrier that can be broken instead
- many ideas can come with this kind of system
