TO DO:
- Skill System Feature

- When selecting unit bring up a UI
- UI has three options:
- attack, skills and wait
- attack is just a regular attack which already exists
- skills will bring up another UI from which that unit can select a skill to use
- skills are in three categories, offense skills, support skills and healing skills
- more ideas of skills for this feature may come down the line
- wait just ends the action of that unit
